# skirvy-odds
Web application to compute odds of a skir battle.

# technical
This is written in Haskell using the Happstack web framework.

After cloning, assuming you have stack installed just:

1. stack setup
2. stack build
3. stack exec skirvy-odds-exe
4. Navigate browser to localhost:8000

If you do not have stack, you can just use Cabal. If you do
not have Cabal, you can just use ghc. If you don't know what
ghc is, this might not be the project for you.
